    "        #### 2- Calculate Customer Age\n",
    "        **Justification:**\n",
    "        - The maximum value in Dt_Customer is 2014 (latest birth year in dataset)\n",
    "        - Assumes data was collected in 2012-2014, making this the baseline year for age calculation\n",
    "        \n",
    "        #### 3- Remove Outliers (Ages > 80)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        #### 4- Set Customer ID as Index\n",
    "        #### 5-Create Total Spending Feature\n",
